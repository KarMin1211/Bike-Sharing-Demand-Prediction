# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

This project involves constructing a generalized linear model to predict bike-sharing demand in South Korea for the upcoming five days. The projected outcomes will be visualized using Power BI.

Key features:
• Utilized API and web scraping techniques to collect data.
• Employed packages such as tidyverse and dplyr to clean and wrangle the dataset.
• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualization using ggplot2.
• Implemented a generalized linear model to build a predictive model for bike-sharing demand.
• Used R script as a data source in Power BI to construct a dashboard, ensuring effective and 
clear communication of results.
